AssetManager

What is AssetManager?

AssetManager is a simple asset manager for iOS using Swift 3 that increases flexibility of the asset resource management thingy-thing-unnecessary-complicated(in my opinion)-iOS asset manager.

As you can tell, I'm not too happy with the way you need to recieve an asset in iOS as of right now.



How does AssetManager work and how do I use it?

AssetManager allows you to read chunks of data from an asset.
You specify the size of the chunks and then choose which chunk in the data you want to extract.

For example:
Let's say your device contains a photo which is 3 MB.
If you set your AssetManager chunk size to 1 MB, that means that you can extract chunk 0, chunk 1 and chunk 2.

You can also calculate the count of chunks for a specific asset.

This type of system is amazingly useful for full control over your assets if you want to send them over a network.

Below is sample code with comments.

The code will set a desired chunk size, followed by extracting a chunk of data from an asset.
